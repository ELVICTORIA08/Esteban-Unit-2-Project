The good side about Gun Control is this can prevent hundreds of deaths, robberys, and School shootings. Did you know according to the website below there were <span style="color:red ">572,537</span> total gun deaths between 1999 and 2016, <span style="color:red">336,579</span> <span style="color:blue">Suicides</span> (58.8% of total gun deaths); <span style="color:red">213,175</span> <span style="color:blue">homicides</span> (37.2%); and 11,428 <span style="color:blue">unintentional deaths</span> (2.0%).

                    <div class="callout-header">Guns don't only cause death. Higher levels of gun violence are also associated with lower home values, credit scores, and homeownership rates. As a result, gun violence hurts a community's housing prices and drives residents to relocate from or avoid moving to affected neighborhoods. No one is gonna want to buy an expensive nice home in a terrible neighborhood which will probably cause your life. Taking guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and people who abuse alcohol, would lower our gun violence rate as a nation. But it would require elected officials to detach themselves from the gun lobby. There are so many issues to consider when voting, but in this midterm election year, I believe that protection from gun violence is one that voters could really advance.

                    <div class="callout-header"> The Amount of school shootings have been increasing, breaking the record having 35 school shootings, there hasn't been this many school shootings since 2018. This is because these laws aren't preventing anyone from having an gun. The State should ban anyone from having an assault rifle, In Europe weapons are banned, all they can use are knifes besides law efforiment, if our State was like that the amount of deaths, School shootings can drop rapidly fixing our huge problem.</div>
